Flows define a group of integrations that your customers can connect to. There are three types of flows that you can enable in hotglue:

## V1 - One-way flows
### Source flow
This is the simplest way to use hotglue, and the default flow type when you toggle off **Bi-directional flows**. With a source flow, your customer connects the `source` or `tap`, and you read data in from those linked sources into your own default target.

### Target flow
This can be enabled in the **General** tab of a V1 flow. This is the inverse of a source flow, where your customer links an integration that you write data out to, but cannot read data in from.

## V2 - Bi-directional flows
If you need to read and write data to the same integration, you can use a bi-directional flow to use the same connection for both. There are two main differences between API calls for V1 and V2 flows:

- V2 flows include a `/v2` in API calls.
- V2 flows do not have a concept of `taps` and `targets`. From the perspective of a V2 flow, everything is a `connector`.
