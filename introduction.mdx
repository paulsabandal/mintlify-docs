## What is hotglue?

hotglue enables you to offer native, user-facing SaaS integrations to your customers in minutes without sacrificing control over the data.

hotglue is embeddable, cloud-based, and built on the Python ecosystem — enabling developers to support more data sources, manage data cleansing & transformation, and offer a self-serve experience to their users. With hotglue, any developer can build a data integration pipeline in minutes without months of development and maintenance.


## What's different about hotglue?

### Open source connectors

All of hotglue's connectors (taps) are completely open source and based on the Singer spec for creating connectors to 3rd party systems. There are already hundreds of connectors available created by open source contributors – including hotglue.

We are partnered with Meltano which is creating a community around the Singer spec to create well-maintained connectors to every 3rd party system you can imagine. In our view, the only way to keep integrations updated with the latest SaaS platforms and other data sources is via an open source community of developers.
