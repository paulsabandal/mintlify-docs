# What is a source?

Each connector that your users can import data from is called a **source**. Sources are grouped together within flows.

For example, an e-commerce flow may include many different **sources**, such as Shopify, Amazon Seller, and WooCommerce.

## What is an available source?

An **available source** is a source that hotglue connects to. You can find a complete list of [available sources here](https://hotglue.com/connectors).

## What is a supported source?

A **supported source** is a source that you have configured to be available within a flow, whether or not any tenant has connected to it.

## What is a linked source?

A **linked source** is a source that has been successfully connected to by a particular tenant.

# Source Configuration

There are four source configuration options in the hotglue app:

1.  Credentials
2.  Field maps
3.  Pre-processing scripts
4.  Triggers

## Credentials

Sources generally use one of two types of authorization: APIs and OAuth. Before enabling an OAuth source, you must obtain and set up OAuth credentials.

1.  Your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** will be found in your company or developer account with that source. Reference
2.  Scope is used for some OAuth applications to define the data you will be reading or writing. This will prompt tenants to confirm the data permissions you are requesting.

## Field maps

Field maps allow you to choose what data hotglue will clone in a sync job.

**The field map** displays a list of **tables** that can be turned on or off. Within each table, **the field editor** displays a list of **fields** that can be cloned or ignored.

To modify a field map for a source, navigate to your chosen flow, click the “Sources” tab, then select a source to configure it.

Under configuration, click “customize field map.” From here, you can toggle **tables** on or off by clicking them.

Click the “edit” pencil button on a given table to add or remove fields.

## Pre-processing script

[Pre-processing scripts](https://docs.hotglue.com/docs/transformations-overview) (or transformation scripts) can be used to transform raw data from your sources into a digestible format for your backend or targets.

## Triggers

Triggers create webhooks on your behalf to automatically run jobs when something happens in a source system.

For example, when a new contact is added in Salesforce, a trigger can automatically run a new sync job.
