# What is a sync job?

hotglue uses sync jobs to move data between your product and the integrations your tenants link.

hotglue is designed to sync data _incrementally_, meaning the first **sync job** pulls all historical data (from a specific _start date_), and subsequent sync jobs only pull the delta data (new or updated records).
