title: 'Allow multiple sources'
description: 'Allows tenants to connect to multiple distinct connectors in the same flow'
---

By default, users are limited to one linked connector per flow. This is because most users need just one integration for each category of connector you use (e.g. 1 CRM, 1 accounting system).

`multipleSources`Â ignores these limits and allows users to link multiple connectors in the same flow (e.g. Hubspot and Salesforce).

## Syntax


```javascript javascript
  multipleSources: true   
```
