## What are secure requests?

Certain requests in hotglue to fetch tenant-specific information require additional authentication for access.

For instance, if you wish to fetch the raw OAuth credentials for a tenant to make your own requests against the source API, you will need to generate a private signing key and use that to generate a JWT token for access to those endpoints.

To access secure requests you will have to follow these steps:

1. Generate a private signing key in the hotglue admin panel
2. Use the private signing key in your backend to generate a JWT token for a specific tenant
3. Forward this JWT token in your request to the hotglue API for access to low-level, tenant specific information

## Generate a private signing key


To generate your private signing key, head to the environment settings page:

From here, press Generate private key under the API Keys section:

<Warning>
**Do not share this private signing key!**

For security purposes, hotglue does not store your private signing key. Keys are unique to every hotglue environment and can only be generated by an admin.
</Warning>

You should now store this private signing key in your backend, and use it to create a JWT token for secure requests.


## Creating a JWT token

Once you have a private signing token generated, you can generate a JWT token from your backend to make secure requests to the hotglue API.

``` javascript
const jsonwebtoken = require('jsonwebtoken');
const currentTime = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000);

// TODO: Change this tenant id
const tenantId = "tenant-id";

const token = jsonwebtoken.sign(
  {
    sub: tenantId,
    iat: currentTime,
    exp: currentTime + (60 * 60), // 1 hour from now
  },
  Buffer.from(process.env['HOTGLUE_SIGNING_KEY'], "base64").toString("utf8"),
  {
    algorithm: "RS256",
  }
);

```

## Using the JWT token
### Widget

When launching the widget you can pass the JWT token to make secure requests using the [options parameter](https://docs.hotglue.com/docs/embed-hotglue-javascript-reference#options):

``` javascript
// Generate the JWT token in your backend using the signing key
// Sample code for this above
const token = getJwtToken();

// Launch the widget
HotGlue.open("tenant-id", {
  jwtToken: token
});

```

## API

<Warning>
The JWT Token is used to access secure information using your Public API Key. If you're trying to make sensitive requests from your backend, use your **Secret API Key** instead.
</Warning>


There are several API requests such as [GET Linked Sources](https://docs.hotglue.com/reference/linked-sources-retrieve) which allow you to pass the JWT token as a query parameter token to access sensitive data on behalf of a tenant while using your public api key.

``` shell
curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://client-api.hotglue.xyz/env_id/flow_id/tenant_id/linkedSources?token=jwtToken' \
     --header 'Accept: application/json' \
     --header 'x-api-key: public_api_key'
```
