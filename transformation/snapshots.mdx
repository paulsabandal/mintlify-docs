# What is snapshotting?

hotglue's transformation layer allows you to save and persist data across sync jobs for every tenant. This feature is called **snapshotting**. Some use cases include:

-   storing some metadata about the tenant necessary for the transformation script to run (some sort of mapping, an API key/identifier, etc.)
-   persisting a **state** of the data that this tenant has already synced. For example, you could keep a full copy of all the data the tenant has synced to detect which records are new vs updated.
-   allowing different integrations to access information about the tenant. For example, you could correlate data across Salesforce and Quickbooks to generate some unified output.

# How to use snapshots?


## Transformation Script

[](https://docs.hotglue.com/docs/snapshots#transformation-script)

**Note:** this guide assumes you've read the [writing a basic script](https://docs.hotglue.com/docs/writing-a-basic-script) of the docs.

As described in the [writing a basic script](https://docs.hotglue.com/docs/writing-a-basic-script#standard-directories) section, one of the standard directories for hotglue transformation scripts is the `snapshots` directory. Any data saved to that directory will be persisted across job runs.

Let's walk through a quick sample using pandas:


``` python util.py
import os
import pandas as pd

def get_snapshot(snapshot_dir, stream):
    snap_path = f"{snapshot_dir}/{stream}.snapshot.csv"

    # Ensure file exists
    if os.path.isfile(snap_path) is False:
        return None

    # Read the old snapshot, if present
    snap_df = pd.read_csv(snap_path)

    return snap_df


def update_snapshot(snapshot_dir, stream, key, data_df, persist=True, override=False,
                    drop_column=None, sort_columns=None, drop_duplicates=True):
    snap_df = data_df

    if drop_duplicates:
        snap_df = snap_df.drop_duplicates(key, keep="last")

    if not override:
        # Get the old snapshot dataframe
        psnap_df = get_snapshot(snapshot_dir, stream)

        if psnap_df is not None:
            # Combine with prior snapshot
            snap_df = snap_df.set_index(
                key).combine_first(psnap_df.set_index(key))
            snap_df = snap_df.reset_index()
    if drop_column is not None:
        snap_df = snap_df.drop(columns=drop_column, errors='ignore')
    if persist:
        # Save this snapshot in correct spot
        snap_path = f"{snapshot_dir}/{stream}.snapshot.csv"
        snap_df.to_csv(snap_path, index=False)

    if sort_columns is not None:
        snap_df.sort_values(by=sort_columns)

    return snap_df
```

The file above defines two functions:

-   `update_snapshot` is designed to take data new data from a job sync, and append it to any existing snapshot. This will ensure every job run has access to the full history of data that has been synced by this tenant
-   `get_snapshot` reads the snapshot directory to get the snapshot for the `stream` id passed (you can think of a `stream` as the name of a table)

Using the above, we could do the following in our `etl.ipynb` to generate a snapshot of all the `Account` data from an integration (like Quickbooks):

``` python etl.ipynb

import gluestick as gs
import pandas as pd
import os

from lib import util

# standard directory for hotglue
ROOT_DIR = os.environ.get("ROOT_DIR", ".")
INPUT_DIR = f"{ROOT_DIR}/sync-output"
OUTPUT_DIR = f"{ROOT_DIR}/etl-output"
SNAPSHOT_DIR = f"{ROOT_DIR}/snapshots"

# Read input data
input_data = gs.read_csv_folder(INPUT_DIR)

# Create a snapshot of the Account stream if it is available
if input_data.get("Account") is not None:
    util.update_snapshot(
        SNAPSHOT_DIR, 
        "Account",
        ['Id'], 
        input_data["Account"]
     )

# Get Account snapshot data
accounts = util.get_snapshot(SNAPSHOT_DIR, "Account")

```

That's all there is to it!

## API


Additionally, you can modify the snapshots on a tenant level [via the API](https://docs.hotglue.com/reference/tenants-delete-snapshot). For example, you could save a tenant `config.json` in the snapshot to store some metadata such as an API key programmatically.
