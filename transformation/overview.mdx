## What are transformation scripts?

hotglue features a transformation layer that can be used to format the raw output from connectors into a format ingestible by your backend (or wherever you're piping the data to).

In hotglue, all transformation scripts are written in Python and can use any open source Python modules you'd like. Since hotglue formats output from data support as CSV files, our sample scripts leverage ourÂ [gluestick](https://github.com/hotgluexyz/gluestick)Â package andÂ [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)Â heavily.

<Warning>
If you do not deploy your script, your changes will be saved butÂ **not**Â used. This is so you don't accidentally break your integration while you're editing it. To learn how to deploy a script, readÂ [Deploy a script](https://docs.hotglue.com/docs/transformations-overview#deploy-the-script).
</Warning>

## Start the JupyterLab workspace

To edit the transformation script for a connector, you can start a JupyterLab workspace directly from hotglue.

Start by opening the settings for the connector you'd like to update. From here, launch the JupyterLab workspace by selecting the Python icon:

<Note>

Generally, when updating the transformation script you should launch the JupyterLab workspace from the admin view â€“Â **not**Â the tenant view. Launching JupyterLab as a tenant create a custom forked script for that tenant.

</Note>

</Frame>

hotglue will provision a hosted JupyterLab workspace for you to connect to â€“Â this may take a few minutes. Once the JupyterLab workspace is provisioned, click the launch button to open your workspace.

Connect to JupyterLab workspace

You've launched JupyterLab and should see something like the below!Â ![:tada:](https://docs.hotglue.com/public/img/emojis/tada.png ":tada:")

##

Define dependencies

[](https://docs.hotglue.com/docs/transformations-overview#define-dependencies)

TheÂ `requirements.txt`Â file in the root directory is where you can specify any Python modules you wish to use as dependencies. In this example, myÂ `requirements.txt`Â contains the following:

requirements.txt

`gluestick==1.0.4 numpy==1.16.2 pandas==0.25.3 requests==2.24.0`

As mentioned above theÂ [gluestick](https://github.com/hotgluexyz/gluestick)Â package is developed by the hotglue team and provides utility functions for reading and manipulating CSV files with pandas. Read theÂ [wiki on GitHub](https://github.com/hotgluexyz/gluestick/wiki).

TheÂ [requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/)Â package can be used to make API requests directly from your transformation script. See the testingÂ `requirements.txt`Â we created in Jupyter below:

##

Edit the script

[](https://docs.hotglue.com/docs/transformations-overview#edit-the-script)

Inside theÂ `etl`Â folder, you will find a file titledÂ `etl.ipynb`Â containing aÂ [default transformation script](https://github.com/hotgluexyz/recipes/blob/master/src/default.ipynb)

![3068](https://files.readme.io/f530f18-Screen_Shot_2021-12-15_at_2.31.18_PM.png "Screen Shot 2021-12-15 at 2.31.18 PM.png")

Default transformation script

You can use this as a base to understand how to read data with theÂ `gluestick`Â package and manipulate it usingÂ `pandas`. You can also find moreÂ [sample scripts available on GitHub](https://github.com/hotgluexyz/recipes/tree/master/src).

##

Deploy the script

[](https://docs.hotglue.com/docs/transformations-overview#deploy-the-script)

Once you have written your transformation script, you must deploy it using the hotglue tab in Jupyter.

Deploy the transformation script

Jupyter will prompt you to confirm the deployment as pictured below:

![3068](https://files.readme.io/d554c88-Screen_Shot_2021-12-15_at_2.36.06_PM.png "Screen Shot 2021-12-15 at 2.36.06 PM.png")

Confirm transformation script deployment

If you do not deploy your script, your changes will be autosaved but willÂ **not**Â be used. Autosaved transformation scripts can be found in theÂ `cached`Â folder.

> Note that the CLI only downloads the deployed version of the script. If you have a script that is not deployed, you will need to load a Jupyter notebook to deploy your cached edits
