## Before you start


This guide assumes you have already launched a JupyterLab workspace, as described in the [Transformations Overview](https://docs.hotglue.com/docs/transformations-overview#start-the-jupyterlab-workspace).

## Access prior job logs and data

If you're debugging why a specific job failed, you can learn more about what caused a job to fail by reading the logs.

To start, navigate to the job that failed (this could be under a specific tenant):

By clicking the download icon next to the job, a zip file will be generated containing the raw data that was was generated during that job. The directory structure is exactly the same as described on [the transformation script docs](https://docs.hotglue.com/docs/writing-a-basic-script#standard-directories).

By clicking the job name, you can access the logs and understand any errors that may have occurred:

### **Find errors quickly**
To speed up debugging, click the down arrow to quickly scan to the most recent logs.

## Clone a job


While in a JupyterLab workspace, you can **clone** the data from a prior job. This is especially useful if you're debugging a specific job that failed, or you need some testing data to develop a script.

Inside of Jupyter, select the hotglue tab and press clone job.

</Frame>

Jupyter will present you with a list of the most recent jobs. Press select on the one you would like to clone.

</Frame>

Once the data is cloned, you'll see a success message as below, and the data will be populated in the `sync-output` folder.

You can preview the data that was cloned in JupyterLab by opening the `sync-output` folder. As you can see, my `subscribe_list` data was cloned:

</Frame>

## Test the script

Now that your data is cloned, you can run your transform script normally and it should pick up the data automatically.

</Frame>


If your script fails, you will see the error in the notebook (`etl.ipynb`). From there, you can change your script and run against the data again.

When your script works correctly, you should see the output files in the `etl-output` folder:

That's all there is to testing your script in hotglue!
