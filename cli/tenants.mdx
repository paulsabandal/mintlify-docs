## What is a subtenant?

**Subtenants** are used when a single tenant needs multiple distinct connections with the same connector. E.g.

- A Shopify connection with multiple stores
- A parent company with multiple CRMs for various acquired companies

Subtenants are denoted as `{ROOT TENANT}){SUB TENANT ID}` (e.g., `companyName_2` ).

## Creating a subtenant

Subtenants must be created via the API, by making a call using the`{ROOT TENANT}_{SUB TENANT ID}` syntax.
