## What is a flow?
In hotglue, each "type" of integration you want to offer users is grouped into a **flow.**

For example, you may want your users to import data from **Development** tools, like GitHub and GitLab, and **E-Commerce** shops, like Shopify and WooCommerce. When your users first open the hotglue widget they'll see something like the following:

<Frame caption="hotglue widget - flows">

</Frame>

This allows your user to select what they wish to import, and more importantly **where they want to import it from.** For example, if your user wanted to import **E-Commerce** data they may be able to import it from sources like Shopify, WooCommerce, and Magento. In the hotglue widget, this would look something like below:

</Frame>


## How do flows help me?

Flows serve two main purposes:

1. Flows let you define **what types of integrations you want to support.** For example, for a **Development** flow you may want to support importing data from GitHub or GitLab - but that doesn't make much sense for an **E-Commerce** flow.

2. Flows make it easy for your users to keep track of their data. Users can clearly see what kinds of data your application needs, and what platforms they can connect.

## Flow Options

### What is a Target flow?

A target flow is when the tenant will link the target instead of the source, so that the data will be written to a tenants connected integration.

For example, if you wanted to export data to your tenants accounting software such as Sage Intacct, that is considered a target flow.
